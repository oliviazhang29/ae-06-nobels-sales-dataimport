```{r load-packages, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
```

* Read in the Excel file called `sales.xlsx` from the `data-raw/` folder 
such that it looks like the following.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-1.png")
```

```{r}

```

* **Stretch goal:** Manipulate the sales data such such that it looks like the 
following.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/sales-2.png")
```

```{r}

```

## Hint 

?read_excel 
read_excel(path, sheet = NULL, range = NULL, col_names = TRUE,
  col_types = NULL, na = "", trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 0,
  n_max = Inf, guess_max = min(1000, n_max),
  progress = readxl_progress(), .name_repair = "unique")
  
  
  1. when you import the data, you can skip redundant rows. in this case, skip=3 seems great. 
  2. when you import the data, you can assign column names. col_names=c("id","n") 
  3. you can make new variable that can detect if vector contains certain value, using mutate() and str_detect(). in this case, we need to detect if "Brand" is in "id"column or not. 
  4. if_else() function would be useful. 
  5. fill() function is needed. 
  
  so, your answer would be like this :
  ??<-read_excel("data-raw/sales.xlsx", ???,???)

?<-?%>%
  mutate(
  ?? = str_detect(id,"Brand"),
  brand = if_else(??,id,NULL)
  ) %>%
  fill(brand) %>%
  filter(??) %>%
  select(brand,id,n)
